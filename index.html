        Born and raised in New York, Wang Cheung was exposed to a myriad of
        cultures and design expressions. She developed an interest in graphic
        and audiovisual design from a young age but it was Fashion Design the
        one that stole her heart and took her to Parsons as soon as she finished
        school. She has since then worked with many renowned brands and artists
        and has very recently created her own label, “Stillness”.
